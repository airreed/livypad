For anyone who seeks medical, dental and eye care, livypad is a reminder system that is synched to existing electronic calendars and informs the user of upcoming or missing appointments recommended by the US Health Human Services and/or covered by respective insurance plans. 

``
Unlike existing calendaring systems, our product provides smart notification when the last and subsequent visit are greater than the recommended time frame or within coverage by an insurance plan.
